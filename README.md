TVSorter


This is a Windows application that is used to look for WMC .wtv files in a known location, look up additional information on the episode from thetvdb.com, then sort the episode in a standard format so the media server applications like Plex and Emby will be happy.

To get started there are a few steps you have to undertake.

1) Get an API key.
This is as easy as filling out a form on TheTVDB's webpage. Read the rules and enter your information, you can find your API key under 'Account'.
